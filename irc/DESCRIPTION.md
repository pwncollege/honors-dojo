A general introduction to IRC servers. 
- In each of these challenges the server can be started by running /challenge/server
- This will turn the current console into the server console.
- It is recommended to connect using Netcat. The IRC server is hosted on 127.0.0.1:667.
- Use [Basic IRC Commands](https://www.mirc.com/help/html/index.html?basic_irc_commands.html) to explore the IRC commands (Note: to run these through Netcat do not include the leading "/")
