# Web3 Wallet Security Fundamentals: A Linux Command Line Approach

A practical, hands-on module focused on Web3/Crypto wallet security, using only the Linux command-line utilities you have learned in class(CSE365).

- **Objective:** Learn fundamental and advanced wallet security concepts by using core Linux commands to simulate real-world security failures and forensic analysis.
- **Commands Used:** `cat`, `grep`, `diff`, `touch`, `tr`, `chmod`, Pipelining, Shell Scripting with Conditionals (`if/then/else`), and Environment Variable usage.

### Challenge Progression

**1. Securing the Seed Phrase**
*   **Core Concept:** Cold Storage Simulation, File Permissions, Simple Obfuscation
*   **Key Commands Used:** `touch`, `cat`, `tr` (Translating chars), `chmod` (Changing Permissions)

**2. The Hot Wallet Exposure**
*   **Core Concept:** Environment Variable Attacks, Private Key Leakage
*   **Key Commands Used:** `grep` (on Exported Variables)

**3. Phishing Content Analysis**
*   **Core Concept:** Content Forensics, Identifying Subtle Fraud
*   **Key Commands Used:** `diff` (comparing files), `grep`

**4. API Key Log Forensics**
*   **Core Concept:** Multi-Stage Log Filtering, Data Pipelining
*   **Key Commands Used:** `grep` (Pipelining/Grepping live output), Text Extraction

**5. Basic Signature Validation**
*   **Core Concept:** Integrity Check Simulation, Scripting Logic
*   **Key Commands Used:** `Scripting with Conditionals` (`if/then/else`), `cat`

It is recommended to have a solid understanding of the commands listed above to successfully complete this module.
